<p> Book description </p>
<p> This distinctive textbook combines comprehensive coverage of the key policy areas of the European Union with analysis of individual countries, including the recent accession countries and Turkey. Part I analyzes the economic bases for the rise of the European Union from its origins in the post-World War II recovery to its historic enlargement in 2004. Part II takes up the different nation-state perspectives on the EU's economic policies by looking in turn at all European countries, whether members of the EU or not. The book is unique in providing both an EU perspective and European nation-state perspective on the major policy issues which have arisen since the end of World War II, as well as putting the economic analysis into an historical narrative which emphasizes the responses of policy-makers to external shocks such as the Cold War, the oil shocks, German reunification, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p>
<p> Reviews </p>
<p> 'Any student venturing to Europe for the first time should go in the company of Rick Steves and Larry Neal. Where Steves' guides provide an entertaining introduction to the main tourist sites, Neal's book offers an accessible analysis of Europe's major economies and institutions. Particularly valuable are Neal's historical walking tours, where he shows how powerfully Europe's history continues to influence its economic arrangements and performance. Highly recommended for the first-time visitor.' </p>
<p> Barry Eichengreen - University of California, Berkeley </p>
<p> 'The author gives more than one analysis of Europe and the European Union, because he balances an insider's perspective with an American view on European economic structures. This makes this textbook indispensable for both the European and the non-European instructor and student.' </p>
<p> Gregor van der Beek - University of Koblenz-Landau </p>

<p> Facts and figures on the European Union economy </p>
<p> How big is the EU economy? </p>
<p> The European Union operates as a single market made up of 27 countries. </p>
<p> The total value of all goods and services produced (gross domestic product or GDP) in the EU in 2021 was € 14.5 trillion. </p>
<p> Trade </p>
<p> The EU27 accounts for around 14% of the world’s trade in goods. The EU, China and the United States are the three largest global players in international trade. </p>
<p> In 2021, the EU accounted for € 4 300 billion in total global trade. Intra-EU trade was valued at € 6 786 billion in 2021. </p>
<p> Employment and equality </p>
<p> The employment rate is the proportion of the working-age population in employment. </p>
<p> The unemployment rate is the number of out-of-work people expressed as a percentage of the total labour force. Both the unemployment rate and the size of the labour force are key indicators of labour-market trends. </p>
<p> The unadjusted gender pay gap is the difference between the average, gross, hourly earnings of male employees and female employees. It is expressed as a percentage of the average, gross, hourly earnings of male employees. It is based on all employees working in firms with 10 or more employees. </p>

<p> Europe </p>
<p> Europe </p>
<p> Europe has historically been a powerhouse of the global economy– from the onset of the industrial revolution in the cities of 19th century Europe, to the revival of capitalism in Europe’s post-war boom in the 20th century, to the European Union’s current status as the world’s largest trading bloc and single market. Collectively, Europe ranks alongside the United States and China as one of the largest economies, with the European Union, which comprises 27 European states, having a collective GDP of almost 16 trillion Euros in 2022. The European economy is not just comprised of the EU countries however, with other important economies in the continent including the United Kingdom, the 6th largest economy by GDP in 2022, as well as the transcontinental countries of Russia (9th largest) and Turkey (20th largest). </p>

<p> European Union </p>
<p> 1957 Treaty Of Rome established the EEC between 6 original members 1960 EFTA between UK, Aus, Den, Nor, Port, Swiss and Swe 1973 UK, Ireland and Denmark join EC 1999 Creating of Euro single currency. </p>
<p> Community Institutions </p>
<p> European Commission, this is the civil service of the EU </p>
<p> Council of Ministers from different countries make decisions on policy </p>
<p> European Council. Meets twice a year to make decisions which fundamentally alter EU policy </p>
<p> European Parliament directly elected body of 626 members </p>
<p> The Court OF Justice. Is based in Luxembourg </p>
<p> Single European Act 1986 </p>
<p> This was an attempt to “relaunch” the EU by attempting to create a Single Market. It was necessary to drop unanimous decision making with an increase in Qualified Majority Voting. The SEA also committed the EU Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) </p>
<p> Treaty of Maastricht 1992 </p>
<p> Economic, social and Political extensions to the EU </p>
<p> Common foreign and security policy </p>
<p> Intergovernmental cooperation on justice and home affairs </p>
<p> Economic Integration </p>
<p> Preference Areas. The Lome conference of 1975 gave preferential treatment to certain developing countries </p>
<p> Customs Union. This is s free trade area with a common external tariff </p>
<p> Single Market – European Union </p>
<p> This occurs when the member countries act as a single economic area with the free movement of labour and capital </p>
<p> No Tariffs on trade between member states </p>
<p> Elimination of border controls </p>
<p> Free movement of People </p>
<p> Monetary Union is a single market plus </p>
<p> Obstacles To Completing the Single Market in the EU </p>
<p> Customs Formalities </p>
<p> Different Tax Rates, especially on Alcohol and tobacco </p>
<p> State Subsidies to domestic industries, or tax breaks to encourage inward investment. This creates unfair competition within the EU </p>
<p> Different regulations added to the cost of business </p>
<p> Different currencies (until the Euro was launched) </p>
<p> Until 1994 there were restrictions on the movement of capital, but these controls have been abolished and gradual liberalization has been made on other aspects of financial services. </p>
<p> Benefits of a Single Market </p>
<p> Trade Creation. Exploitation of comparative adv allows lower prices and costs. Leading to higher output and more employment </p>
<p> Adverse regional multiplier effects. The creation of a single market tends to attract capital and jobs away from the periphery areas to the centre. </p>
<p> Development of Monopoly/ Oligopoly power </p>
<p> Trade Diversion. If external barriers remain high countries could lose out </p>
<p> EU Competition Policy </p>
<p> The EU competition has the power to examine mergers to see whether they are in the public interest. They are not always opposed to mergers because they can have benefits such as </p>
<p> Economies of scale </p>
<p> Greater international competition. </p>
<p> However the abuse of market power can cause problems such as higher prices, unfair competition. </p>
<p> A merger could be referred to the commission if </p>
<p> New Firm has greater than £3.6 billion </p>
<p> Less than 2/3 of the new firm comes from one member state (therefore there is still a role for national commissions) </p>
<p> Other unfair business practices include </p>
<p> 1. Price fixing and market sharing Cartels. In 1994 the major steel manufacturers were fines 7% of their turnover for fixing prices </p>
<p> Social Aspects of the Single Market </p>
<p> The Social Charter </p>
<p> This aimed to give greater protection to workers in the EU it included the following: </p>
<p> Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has forced Europe to confront its shortcomings with regard to providing its own security and to reconsider its reliance on the United States, which may be – under a potential Trump administration – much less supportive. This Forum focuses on what needs to be done now to address Europe’s security concerns and guarantee stability for the foreseeable future. Is meeting NATO spending targets enough to support European defence? What would it take to make Europe more self-sufficient? How does Europe protect itself against malicious cyberattacks? And what role do women specifically play in supporting defence efforts and future reconstruction in Ukraine? </p>
<p> After decades marked by struggles to combat high unemployment, today’s main challenge is labour market shortages. Since the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and despite the economic slowdown driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, EU labour markets have demonstrated remarkable resilience. Employment reached a record high in 2022 and the trend is expected to continue. Most companies, in the EU and beyond, are now struggling to fill vacancies. Labour and skill shortages in several sectors are the new problems to overcome. What are the reasons behind these shortages? Are these only temporary issues? </p>
<p> In June 2024, EU citizens will vote in the European Parliament elections – two years into Russia’s war in Ukraine and on European values, after the COVID-19 pandemic and the finalisation of Brexit, and with the possibility of Donald Trump winning the US presidential election later this year. In a turbulent geopolitical environment, the European Parliament elections will reshape the political landscape in Brussels, where traditional parties are being challenged and an increasing tilt towards right-wing governance is unmistakable. In the lead-up to the elections, this Forum focuses on some of the issues that will take centre stage for voters and define the next phase of European politics. </p>
<p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that is transforming every aspect of life. It has already started to revolutionise the way we communicate, conduct research, analyse data and streamline labour processes. However, AI also requires understanding and regulation in order to address issues such as algorithmic bias and data access obstacles that will inevitably impact society, governance and the economy. This Forum examines the challenges and opportunities of AI in the EU and beyond. </p>
<p> The EU has weathered a number of turbulent storms in recent years from the COVID-19 pandemic to the ongoing war in Ukraine. These crises have highlighted the limitations of the EU budget and the need for the flexibility to adequately respond to challenges in real time. They have also raised questions about the legal feasibility of more common debt following a dramatic increase in EU borrowing. What are the obstacles – and the opportunities – for the EU’s public finances in the face of the numerous crises of our time? Is it possible to balance predictability for long-term investments and flexibility to react to unexpected turns of events? This Forum addresses these questions and builds on the discussions at the 2023 joint Intereconomics/CEPS conference. </p>
<p> European air defence is a European public good. Joint funding is thus justified to ensure sufficient provisioning, write Armin Steinbach and Guntram Wolff. Debt funding is economically justified and would also benefit the development of European industrial defence capacities in air defence. </p>
<p> The realisation that Europe’s defence industry needs political support has taken some time, but it is now an important point of consensus between EU member states and political groupings in the European Parliament. Yet, as Daniel Fiott argues, defence expenditure is an intensely political affair, which makes our ability to assess the quality of defence investments harder. </p>
<p> China uses subsidies extensively to take a leading role in the global markets of green-tech products such as battery electric vehicles and wind turbines. Against the background of the current EU investigations into Chinese subsidies in these sectors, Frank Bickenbach, Dirk Dohse, Rolf Langhammer and Wan-Hsin Liu take a careful look at the Chinese subsidy system. </p>
<p> The recent NATO Summit in Washington was a missed opportunity, writes Ben Hodges. The priority of the West has been avoiding escalation with Russia. But this is actually prolonging the war in Ukraine and giving Russia the time it needs to rebuild its forces. </p>
<p> A paradigm shift from reactive to active cyber defence is only justifiable with democratic support. At the foundation of this approach is a public understanding of the strategic environment and of the conditions that shape cyberspace as a permanently contested field of conflict, write Annegret Bendiek and Jakob Bund. </p>
<p> Trump's plans, should he return to the White House, include reducing the role of the federal income tax and replacing it with revenues from sky-high tariffs on imports. This would be deeply harmful to both the US economy and the world economy, write Kimberly Clausing and Maurice Obstfeld. </p>
<p> Quote of the Month </p>
<p> "Put simply, defence can only truly thrive when it benefits from a consistent source of investment over multiple years and decades. Kick-starting a virtuous defence industrial cycle, where militaries can procure cost-effective and high-performance equipment and systems, requires long-term planning and investments." </p>
<p> Current Issue </p>
<p> Figure of the Month </p>
<p> Annual average peace dividend and investment deficits, 1990-2023 (bn euros, price adjusted, 2023 prices) </p>
<p> After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the threat of war on Europe’s eastern border ended and defence spending fell significantly in all countries. Many European NATO members reduced their annual expenditure to a very low level of 1.1%-1.5% of GDP – including Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. As a result, national governments generated an annual “peace dividend” for other spending categories, primarily to finance and expand their welfare states. </p>
